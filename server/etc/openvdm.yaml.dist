siteRoot: "http://127.0.0.1/"

# The transferInterval defines the interval for performing collectionSystemTransfer.
# The unit is in minutes.
transferInterval: 5

# The gearmanServer is the location and port number for the Gearman server used in
# conjunction with OpenVDM.  The required format is <server>:<port>
gearmanServer: "localhost:4730"

# Whether or not to hide all directories in the CruiseData directory other than the
# current cruise. (True|False)

# Whether or not to move the contents of the PublicData share to the cruise data
# directory. (True|False)
transferPubicData: False

# maximum age of transfer log files to retain. String must conform with the python
# datetime.timedelta standard
# logfilePurgeTimedelta: "12 hours"

# The plugins section defines where the plugins processing scripts reside
# and the expected suffix for each processing file.  It should include 2 directives:
# processingScriptDir --> the full path containing the plugins processing scripts
# processingScriptSuffix --> the suffix appended to plugins processing scripts
#     i.e. with SCS_dataDashboard.py the suffix is _dataDashboard.py

# The hooks section contains any additional Gearman tasks that should be performed
